 My life experience this 2020 is like a roller coaster. But first, I would like to thank God for keeping me, my friends, and my family safe. When this pandemic started, we are not that panicked because we bought enough resources for us but as the time goes buy, living in our own prison, and having a hard time for my Dad to earn his wages, we really had a rough times. But God was still there, providing for us and still protecting us from any harm. This 2020, all I want is safety, nothing more nothing less. We had fought challenges, and trials but this one is the worst so far. I am dealing with my emotions because of what is happening around me. Ash falls, COVID 19, strong storms and etc. 2020 gives us a rough time to enjoy and limits our daily routine. But again, this is just a bad year, not a bad life. So I'm looking forward for a fruitful and happy year, this 2021 and hoping for resurgence in every people in the world. <br><br><br>
